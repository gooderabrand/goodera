  This snippet renders a list of recently viewed products.
  It is intended to be rendered via AJAX or populated by JavaScript.
  It expects a list of product handles to be available, likely fetched client-side.

  This snippet itself cannot directly fetch products based on handles passed to it
  because Liquid executes on the server before the page loads and client-side data (like recently viewed handles in localStorage)
  is available. The fetching and rendering of recently viewed products must happen via JavaScript.
  The JavaScript in product-suggestions-tabs.js will handle fetching the HTML for recently viewed products
  using the search URL approach found in recently-viewed-products.js and insert it here.
